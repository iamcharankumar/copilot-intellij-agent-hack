# Turn IntelliJ Into a Context-Aware AI Powerhouse with Claude and MCP

Boost your dev productivity with AI agents powered by Claude + Playwright/Selenium + MCP in IntelliJ like a boss. No,
you won't require Claude desktop this time. ðŸ˜‰

Simple Idea

> The LLMs [Large Language Models] has no decision-making capability.
> So think MCP as your middleware, which use an LLM and talk to you application.
> In this case our application is [Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com/).
> When An LLM is integrated with MCP, we get an AI
> Agent that will help you in decision-making process.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

1. IntelliJ IDEA (latest)
2. Node.js + npm (LTS)
3. GitHub Copilot IntelliJ Plugin

## AI Agent Preview: MCP Server Setup

Use the provided config file to run MCP Servers for Playwright and Selenium.

The below json is configured with the
official [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) server
and [Angie Jones' Selenium MCP for Claude Desktop](https://github.com/angiejones/mcp-selenium?tab=readme-ov-file#use-with-other-mcp-clients-eg-claude-desktop-etc).

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    },
    "selenium": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@angiejones/mcp-selenium"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

1. Make sure the above json file is named as `mcp.json` and save in the location
   `~/.config/github-copilot/intellij/mcp.json.` The config folder is a hidden folder. So make sure that it is unhidden
   while placing it. Once you completed this step, execute the below command from your terminal.
2. Execute `cat ~/.config/github-copilot/intellij/mcp.json` to see the content of the `mcp.json` file.
3. You should be able to see the mcp.json file content like shown in the below image.

4. Now open your IntelliJ and enter the example prompt to see the MCP + LLM integration.

## What will blow your mind?

1. The agent understands login state â€” without you telling it.
   Thatâ€™s real contextual awareness. No more explaining whether you're logged in or not â€” it just knows, and adapts.
2. You can ask for Playwright + TestNG (Java 8, 17, etc.)
   It generates production-ready automation scripts, not just toy examples.
   Youâ€™ll be committing those outputs straight to your feature branch â€” seriously, check the demo video.
